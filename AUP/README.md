# HELLO Buddy

> You can use this read me as a guide.

- List of important files.
  - `fileWatcher.py`
  - `FwLibrary.py`
  - `tools/csvFileInspector.py`
  - logging related file

- you need to look above-mentioned files. other than these files are just for my experiment, testing purpose some of these files or functions are created to make work easy like `clean_from_root.py`. if you want then check it else ignore.

> To run the script;
```shell
    python3 fileWatcher.py config.json lagacy_flag
```

- Go to file location and run this command with respected python exe file. in my case I have `Python3`. 
- It took a `config.json` which can act as `.env` file for this script.
- `legacy_flag` is optional. provide if you want to run legacy mode.
